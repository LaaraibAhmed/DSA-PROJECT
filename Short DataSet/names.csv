nm2421834,Eric Chapus,Eric Chapus,,"Growing up in St. Tropez in the south of France- Endorphin (aka Eric Chapus) found the allure of exotic lands too great. Traveling to India- Goa- Morocco and throughout the USA in a customized VW Kombi- Eric finally took roots in the tropical rainforests of Queensland (Australia) in a little mountain village called Kuranda. Making music with several experimental ""art"" bands in the 90's Eric began to make music of his own in his forest studio. Entering a national music competition and winning- Eric came into the spotlight after being ""unearthed"" by JJJ (The Australian National Youth Radio Network). Subsequently Sony Music signed him for a five album deal worldwide.In 1996 he delivered an impressive debut album ""Embrace"" and started touring his live electronic show- an eclectic array of visual imagery- music and performance. Endorphin's unique performances have toured with Gatecrasher- Moby- Massive Attack- Portishead- Faithless- Kosheen- Black Eyed Peas and many more nationally.After relocating to Sydney- his second album ""Skin"" reflected a more gritty musical landscape. ""Skin"" drew accolades from both the dance music and mainstream media and won 'Album of the Year' at the inaugural Australian Dance Music Awards. He was also nominated for Best Male Artist at the 2000 ARIA Awards. Endorphins third album- a double CD ""AM/PM"" bought together the two edges to Endorphin's sword. A fusion of ambient sounds found on ""Embrace"" to the robust edginess of ""Skin""- AM/PM delivered the fusion of the chilled out lounge room experience with the four on the floor of the live dance performance. With new audiences now converted- Endorphin was invited to play in Mexico City for the World APEC meeting- Canadian Music Week and the Venezuela Arts Festival in 2002. The demand for Endorphin's music continued to grow with his work included in the Australian hit film ""Looking for Ali Brandi"" and ""Angst""- The 2007 Hollywood trailer for Christopher Walken's new movie ""Balls of Fury""- Scored ""The Story Of The Kelly Gang"" 1906 for the National Film and Sound Archive- a national TV campaign for JJJ (ABC TV)- Jack McCoy's Feature Surf film called ""Blue Horizon"" and ""TO""- Adventure Planet (Beyond Productions)- ""Next Wave""(National Geographic USA)- ""Body Wars"" (Beyond Productions)- ""Martial Hot Spots"" (Discovery Channel)- Sleeper Cell (USA TV)- ""The Block"" (USA TV)- Neighbour's (UK & AUS TV) - McLeod (AUS TV)- Kylie Kwong: Cooking with Heart and Soul (ABC TV)- ""Love Is A Four Letter Word"" (ABC TV)- ""Heartbreak High"" (ABC TV)- ""Head Start"" (ABC TV)- ""Above The Law"" (ABC TV)-""The Cooks"" (ABC TV) and much more. His fourth Album ""Seduction"" expanded his musical repertoire combining rhythmic dance textures with translucent melodic layers infused with a new jazz influence. Endorphin again blends his signature sounds while exploring new musical collaborations with live musicians and singers offering the listener an album that weaves through many levels of emotionally charged tracks. Throughout Endorphin's career he embraces working with some iconic Australian musicians mixing tracks for Icehouse- Paul Kelly- Spiderbait- Sonic Animation- Sunk Loto- Men At Work- Jimmy Little and Tina Arena. With over twenty international compilations including his music the most well known would be on CafÇ¸ Del Mar 6 with his classic track ""Satie"". After a grueling touring for most of the year Endorphin finally took time off the road. Back into the studio once again Endorphin began collaborating with signer/songwriters to produce his next Album called ""Shake It"". Producing an impressive mixture of Middle Eastern sounds- break beats- retro pop- seasoned by soaring female vocals and strong and driving male vocals. Resulting in a very tasteful and spicy dish.With an impressive and successful catalog of music already under his belt- many International companies have been eager to brand their product with Endorphin's music some of which include AMEX (USA)- Sony Digital (UK)- British Aerospace- DNKY Jeans- BMW (Germany)- Sony Ericson- Coca-Cola- The Ritz- Carlton- Four Seasons (Beverly Hills) During 2005 Endorphin was invited to showcase at The World Expo in Japan as the face of contemporary Australian music. Whilst in Japan Eric uses the time there to source sound grabs and interview people that will find its way into his sixth album ""Soon After Silence"". Intent on creating an album that comes from the heart- a very personal soundscape- the latest and critically acclaimed album ""Soon After Silence"" (2007) is a real opus. It is a multi-layered journey rich in texture and meaning. The title track ""Soon after Silence"" reflects the Parisian life Endorphin once led. The sounds echo walks through the streets of Paris and embodies many of the innovative and emotional qualities that are Endorphin's signature.On the touring side in 2007- Endorphin just got back from a huge 7 week National tour of China including 13 major cities",,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0

nm0003425,Asta Nielsen,Asta Sofie Amalie Nielsen,,"Danish leading woman of German films who became one of the greatest stars of the silent era. A native of the Copenhagen suburb of Vesterbro- Nielsen was the daughter of a coppersmith and a washerwoman- both of whom died before Nielsen was fifteen. Her stage debut came as a child in the chorus of the Kongelige Teater's production of Boito's opera ""Mephistopheles."" She studied at the Royal Theatre School of Copenhagen and embarked upon a stage career in her late teens. She toured Scandinavia and became one of the highest-paid and most popular stage actresses of her time and place. In 1909- director Urban Gad suggested that the silent screen would allow her to transcend her Danish language barrier- and she agreed appear in his film 'Afgrunden (1910)'. The film was successful and Nielsen was encouraged to continue in this new art form. A German distributor- Paul Davidson- invited Nielsen to Germany- where he was building a film studio which would eventually become Europe's largest--the Universum Film Union A.-G. (or Ufa). Nielsen and her director- Gad- whom she had married- went to Germany and spent the next quarter century there. She became one of the true superstars of the silent screen- a tragic heroine whose photograph during the First World War accompanied German and also British and French troops into battle. Among her notable films after the war was a version of ""Hamlet- "" which was not so much a Shakespearean film as it was an exploration of a then-current theory that the real Hamlet had been- in fact- a woman. Nielsen played the title role. She continued to play a wide variety of roles in Germany and occasionally in Denmark and Norway- never losing the respect and popularity she had maintained almost from the beginning of her career. She abandoned her film work just as sound was taking over the industry. Aside from one or two brief forays in talkies- her acting was thereafter confined to the stage. She died in 1972 at the age of 89- shortly after her fifth marriage.",September 11- 1881 in¶ÿVesterbro- Copenhagen- Denmark,1881-09-11,Vesterbro- Copenhagen- Denmark,May 24- 1972 in¶ÿFrederiksberg- Denmark ¶ÿ(after a leg fracture),24/05/1972,Frederiksberg- Denmark ¶ÿ,after a leg fracture,"Anders Christian Theede  (21 January¶ÿ1970 - 25 May¶ÿ1972)¶ÿ(her death)

nm0699637,Valdemar Psilander,Valdemar Einar Psilander,,"Young Danish Valdemar tried to make a success in the theatre when he first appeared on Casino Teater in 1901. He never succeeded on the stage - his voice didn't sound right! But notices were otherwise kind to him.Psilander was good-looking- charming and exuding a certain joie-de-vivre. He soon abandoned his plans of becoming an opera singer- preferring the new medium of motion pictures in 1910.Soon he became a raving hit all over Europe (especially Russia - but never USA) and his exorbitant salary made him the most successful actor at Nordisk Film. In an international vox populi he would even out-shine Asta Nielsen- Henny Porten- Max Linder and other stars.Psilander believed in having fun. The enormous amounts of money (pre-income tax) he made- was spent on a care-free way of life with friends and colleagues. Marrying actress Edith Buemann (1879-1968) in 1911 made no change to his bon-vivant lifestyle. When they separated in 1916 - after long periods of separations - the marriage settlement made her a very wealthy divorcÇ¸e and she would always speak and write affectionately of Valdemar until she died - even after four marriages. During this only marriage and after the divorce- he was associated with actress Gudrun Houlberg. They appeared together in ""Klovnen""- 1917.During the end of 1916 his salary demands were so outrageous that Nordisk Film had to let him go. He was tired of the same old material and he wanted to form his own production company. After having hired actors- actresses- directors and writers - it all suddenly came to a halt.He died in his suite at Bristol Hotel- Copenhagen- at the age of 32 - at the pinnacle of his career.To this very day rumors will insist that Psilander took his own life. In 1917 Nordisk Film would suppress the fact that he HAD died- afraid that the truth might hurt ticket sales.However- records have shown that Psilander had a severe heart condition involving a lot of medication. Combining this with a stressful career as a burgeoning producer ultimately resulted in a brain hemorrhage.But like so many others his early death made him even more popular all over Europe.A notable theater/film colleague had this to say about Psilander: He had a wonderful physique and a splendid face. He was a great charmer and a ladies hero- but his talent was mediocre if not ordinary.Clara Wieth (1883-1975) - who appeared with him in 11 films - had this to say of Psilander: In front of the camera he would just prance around ""putting on airs""- but he did it so splendidly with a keen knowledge of camera technique that it was truly believable.",May 9- 1884 in¶ÿCopenhagen- Denmark,1884-05-09,Copenhagen- Denmark,March 6- 1917 in¶ÿCopenhagen- Denmark,06/03/1917,Copenhagen- Denmark,,Edith Buemann  (? - ?),1,0,0,0

He became an ambassador and a prior- but after finding himself on the opposite side of the political party in power he was forced to flee Florence in 1301- never able to return to the city of his birth. He narrowly escaped being executed for treason.Dante left for Verona and Ravenna- where he was joined by his children. He then wrote his most famous work- ""Commedia""- not in scholarly Latin but in the vernacular Italian of the time- giving his countrymen a literature of their own. In it he would resurrect the love of his youth- Beatrice- giving her a place among the angels. This work would also take the author- escorted by the Roman poet Publius Vergilius Maro- on a grand tour to Hell and Purgatory- and later by his beloved Beatrice to Paradise. History would later judge Dante's creation to be divine. Dante Alighieri died in 1321 and was buried in Ravenna. Three sons--Pietro- Jacopo and Giovanni--and a daughter- Antonia- survived him.",June 1- 1265 inÂ Florence- Republic of Florence [now Tuscany- Italy],1265-06-01,Florence- Republic of Florence [now Tuscany- Italy],September 14- 1321 inÂ Ravenna- Papal State [now Emilia-Romagna- Italy] Â (malaria),1321-09-14,Ravenna- Papal State [now Emilia-Romagna- Italy] Â ,malaria,Gemma di Manetto Donati  (1285 - 14 SeptemberÂ 1321)Â (his death)Â (4 children),1,0,1,4
